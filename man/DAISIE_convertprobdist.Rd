\title{Converts the joint distribution of endemics and non-endemics under the
DAISIE model to list format}
\usage{
DAISIE_convertprobdist(pb)
}
\arguments{
\item{pb}{Probability distribution in matrix format as output by
DAISIE_probdist}
}
\value{
A list of length nrow(pb) containing matrices of square dimensions
of size sqrt(ncol - 1) containing the joint probabilities with endemics in
the rows and non-endemics in the columns. The last element of the list is a
vector a times at which the joint probability distribution is evaluated.
}
\description{
This function converts the joint distribution of the number of endemics and
non-endemics from the matrix format of DAISIE_probdist to a list format
}
\examples{

### Compute the probability distribution at t = 4 and t = 8, for a mainland pool
# size of 250 potential colonists and a vector of 5 parameters (cladogenesis, extinction,
# clade-level carrying capacity, immigration, anagenesis) starting from an empty
# island; store in list format

pb <- DAISIE_probdist(
   pars1 = c(0.3,0.35,Inf,0.75,0.012),
   pars2 = c(100,250),
   tvec = c(4,8),
   initEI = c(0,0),
   initprobs = NULL
   )
prob_dists <- DAISIE_convertprobdist(pb)
