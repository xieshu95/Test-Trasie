\description{
A table containing the colonization and branching times of the terrestrial
avifauna in the Galapagos.  Each row on the table represents and independent
colonisation event. The table has four columns. \cr \cr
\code{$Clade_name} -
name of independent colonization event \cr
\code{$Status} - One of the
following categories: \cr
* Non_endemic: for cases where both island and non-island populations of the species have been sampled) \cr
* Non_endemic_MaxAge: for cases where island population of the species has not
been sampled and only the age of the species is available) \cr
* Endemic: applicable for both cladogenetic or anagenetic species \cr
* Endemic&Non_Endemic: when endemic clade and mainland ancestor has
re-colonized \cr
\code{$Missing_species} - Number of island species that
were not sampled for particular clade (only applicable for endemic clades)\cr
\code{$Branching_times} - Stem age of the population/species in the case
of Non-endemic, Non-endemic_MaxAge and Endemic anagenetic species. For
cladogenetic species these should be branching times of the radiation
including the stem age of the radiation.\cr
