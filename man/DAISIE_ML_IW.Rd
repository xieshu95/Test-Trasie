\title{Maximization of the loglikelihood under the DAISIE model with island-wide
diversity-dependence}
\usage{
DAISIE_ML_IW(datalist, initparsopt, idparsopt, parsfix, idparsfix,
  res = 100, ddmodel = 11, cond = 0, tol = c(1e-04, 1e-05, 1e-07),

}
\arguments{
\item{datalist}{Data object containing information on colonisation and
branching times. This object can be generated using the DAISIE_dataprep
function, which converts a user-specified data table into a data object, but
the object can of course also be entered directly. It is an R list object
with the following elements.\cr The first element of the list has two three
components: \cr \cr \code{$island_age} - the island age \cr
\code{$not_present} - the number of mainland lineages that are not present
on the island \cr The remaining elements of the list each contains
information on a single colonist lineage on the island and has 5
components:\cr \cr \code{$colonist_name} - the name of the species or clade
that colonized the island \cr \code{$branching_times} - island age and stem
age of the population/species in the case of Non-endemic, Non-endemic_MaxAge
and Endemic anagenetic species. For cladogenetic species these should be
island age and branching times of the radiation including the stem age of
the radiation.\cr \code{$stac} - the status of the colonist \cr \cr *
Non_endemic_MaxAge: 1 \cr * Endemic: 2 \cr * Endemic&Non_Endemic: 3 \cr *
Non_endemic: 4 \cr * Endemic_MaxAge: 5 \cr \cr \code{$missing_species} -
number of island species that were not sampled for particular clade (only
applicable for endemic clades) \cr}

\item{initparsopt}{The initial values of the parameters that must be
optimized}

\item{idparsopt}{The ids of the parameters that must be optimized. The ids
are defined as follows: \cr \cr id = 1 corresponds to lambda^c (cladogenesis
rate) \cr id = 2 corresponds to mu (extinction rate) \cr id = 3 corresponds
to K (clade-level carrying capacity) \cr id = 4 corresponds to gamma
(immigration rate) \cr id = 5 corresponds to lambda^a (anagenesis rate) \cr}

\item{parsfix}{The values of the parameters that should not be optimized}

\item{idparsfix}{The ids of the parameters that should not be optimized,
e.g. c(1,3) if lambda^c and K should not be optimized.}

\item{res}{Sets the maximum number of species for which a probability must
be computed, must be larger than the size of the largest clade}

\item{ddmodel}{Sets the model of diversity-dependence: \cr \cr ddmodel = 0 :
no diversity dependence \cr ddmodel = 1 : linear dependence in speciation
rate \cr ddmodel = 11: linear dependence in speciation rate and in
immigration rate \cr ddmodel = 2 : exponential dependence in speciation
rate\cr ddmodel = 21: exponential dependence in speciation rate and in
immigration rate\cr}

\item{cond}{cond = 0 : conditioning on island age \cr cond = 1 :
conditioning on island age and non-extinction of the island biota \cr}

\item{tol}{Sets the tolerances in the optimization. Consists of: \cr reltolx
= relative tolerance of parameter values in optimization \cr reltolf =
relative tolerance of function value in optimization \cr abstolx = absolute
tolerance of parameter values in optimization}

\item{maxiter}{Sets the maximum number of iterations in the optimization}

\item{methode}{Method of the ODE-solver. See package deSolve for details.
Default is "lsodes"}

\item{optimmethod}{Method used in likelihood optimization. Default is
"subplex" (see subplex package). Alternative is 'simplex' which was the
method in previous versions.}

\item{verbose}{Specifies whether intermediate output should be provided,
because optimizationmay take long. Default is 0, no output. A value of 1
means the parameters and loglikelihood are printed. A value of 2 means also
intermediate progress during loglikelihood computation is shown.}

\item{tolint}{Vector of two elements containing the absolute and relative
tolerance of the integration}
}
\value{
The output is a dataframe containing estimated parameters and
maximum loglikelihood.  \item{lambda_c}{ gives the maximum likelihood
estimate of lambda^c, the rate of cladogenesis} \item{mu}{ gives the maximum
likelihood estimate of mu, the extinction rate} \item{K}{ gives the maximum
likelihood estimate of K, the carrying-capacity} \item{gamma}{ gives the
maximum likelihood estimate of gamma, the immigration rate }
\item{lambda_a}{ gives the maximum likelihood estimate of lambda^a, the rate
of anagenesis} \item{loglik}{ gives the maximum loglikelihood} \item{df}{
gives the number of estimated parameters, i.e. degrees of feedom}
\item{conv}{ gives a message on convergence of optimization; conv = 0 means
convergence}
}
\description{
This function computes the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of
the DAISIE model with island-wide diversity-dependence for data from
lineages colonizing an island. It also outputs the corresponding
loglikelihood that can be used in model comparisons.
}
\details{
The result of sort(c(idparsopt, idparsfix)) should be identical to c(1:5).
If not, an error is reported that the input is incoherent. The same happens
when the length of initparsopt is different from the length of idparsopt,
and the length of parsfix is different from the length of idparsfix.\cr
