\arguments{
\item{datatable}{Data frame (table) with user-specified data. See file
Galapagos_datatable.Rdata for a template of an input table. Each row on the
table represents and independent colonisation event. Table has the following
four columns. \cr \cr \code{$Clade_name} - name of independent colonization
event \cr \code{$Status} - One of the following categories: \cr *
"Non_endemic": applies to non-endemic species for cases where both island
and non-island populations of the species have been sampled) \cr *
"Non_endemic_MaxAge": applies to non-endemic species for cases where island
individuals of the species have not been sampled and only the age of the
species is available) \cr * "Endemic": applies to endemic species and is
applicable for both cladogenetic and anagenetic species \cr *
"Endemic_MaxAge": applies to endemic species for cases where island
individuals of the species have not been sampled and only the age of the
species is available. This could apply to endemic species that have recently
gone extinct because of antropogenic causes that are (evidently) not
modelled, and for which no DNA data is available.\cr *
"Endemic&Non_Endemic": when endemic clade is present and its mainland
ancestor has re-colonized \cr \code{$Missing_species} - Number of island
species that were not sampled for particular clade (only applicable for
"Endemic" clades) \cr \code{$Branching_times} - Stem age of the
population/species in the case of "Non-endemic", "Non-endemic_MaxAge" and
"Endemic" anagenetic species. For "Endemic" cladogenetic species these
should be branching times of the radiation including the stem age of the
radiation.\cr}

\item{island_age}{Age of island in appropriate units}

\item{M}{The size of the mainland pool, i.e the number of species that can
potentially colonize the island}

\item{number_clade_types}{Number of clade types. Default: number_clade_types
= 1 all species are considered to belong to same macroevolutionary process.
If number_clade_types = 2, there are two types of clades with distinct
macroevolutionary processes.}

\item{list_type2_clades}{If number_clade_types = 2, list_type2_clades
specifies the names of the clades that have a distinct macroevolutionary
process. The names must match those in the $Clade_name column of the source
data table (e.g. list_type2_clades = "Finches").  If number_clade_types = 1,
then list_type2_clades = NA should be specified (default)}

\item{prop_type2_pool}{Specifies the fraction of potential mainland
colonists that have a distinct macroevolutionary process. Applies only if
number_clade_types = 2.  Default "proportional" sets the fraction to be
proportional to the number of clades of distinct macroevolutionary process
that have colonised the island. Alternatively, the user can specify a value
between 0 and 1 (e.g. if mainland pool size is 1000 and prop_type2_pool =
0.02 then number of type2 species is 20).}

\item{epss}{Default= 1E-5 should be appropriate in most cases. This value is
used to set the maximum age of colonisation of "Non_endemic_MaxAge" and
"Endemic_MaxAge" species to an age that is slightly younger than the island
for cases when the age provided for that species is older than the island.
The new maximum age is then used as an upper bound to integrate over all
possible colonisation times.}

\value{
\item{datalist}{ R list object containing data:\cr The first element
of the list has two or three components: \cr \code{$island_age} - the island
age \cr Then, depending on whether a distinction between species types is
made, we have:\cr \code{$not_present} - the number of mainland lineages that
are not present on the island \cr or:\cr \code{$not_present_type1} - the
number of mainland lineages of type 1 that are not present on the island \cr
\code{$not_present_type2} - the number of mainland lineages of type 2 that
are not present on the island \cr The following elements of the list each
contains information on a single colonist lineage on the island and has 5
components:\cr \code{$colonist_name} - the name of the species or clade that
colonized the island \cr \code{$branching_times} - island age and stem age
of the population/species in the case of "Non-endemic", "Non-endemic_MaxAge"
and "Endemic" anagenetic species. For "Endemic" cladogenetic species these
are island age and branching times of the radiation including the stem age
of the radiation.\cr \code{$stac} - the status of the colonist \cr *
Non_endemic_MaxAge: 1 \cr * Endemic: 2 \cr * Endemic&Non_Endemic: 3 \cr *
Non_endemic: 4 \cr * Endemic_MaxAge: 5 \cr \code{$missing_species} - number
of island species that were not sampled for particular clade (only
applicable for endemic clades) \cr \code{$type_1or2} - whether the colonist
belongs to type 1 or type 2 \cr }

\description{
This function produces a data object that can be run in DAISIE likelihood
computation/optimization functions. The function converts a user-specified
table to a DAISIE-compatible format. See Galapagos_datatable.Rdata for a
template of an input table.)
}
\details{
The output is an R list containing the data formatted to be run on other
DAISIE functions.
